# KirangHaerang
Woowahan Brothers Inc. is a leading food-tech company in Korea. It provides the food delivery application ‘Baedal Minjok,’ which is known for no commission fees. It also has a service focused on delivering food from famous restaurants, named ‘Baemin Riders’, and is the number one mobile grocery store, ‘Baemin Chan.’ It has developed a set of fonts that are provided for everybody, from designers to restaurant owners. The fonts are named after our employee’s kids’ names, like Hanna and Jua. Badal Minjok’s fonts are inspired by Korean signage from the 1960s and 70s, Jeju’s taffy handcart, faded toilet sign in the parks of Homigot and Pohang, and so on. Baedal Minjok designs may not be classically beautiful, or follow the latest trends of professional designers. +Instead, they respect the lovely glances of normal people. 

KirangHaerang is made by filling the inside of the outline of crooked handwriting which became crooked after trying so hard to write neatly. A little bit over-sized "ㅇ" is the biggest feature.
